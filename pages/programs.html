                <br>
                <p>Northwestern SHPE's Freshmen Round program provides Northwestern first-years an opportunity to engage and work 
                    closely with our organization and executive board. Participants learn more about different aspects of our 
                    chapter that run SHPE NU and receive mentorship on navigating Northwestern and maximizing their first-year 
                    experience by providing participants an opportunity to engage and plan out events for our chapter and its community. 
                    Participants of FRT are encouraged to run for an official executive board position for the following school year.

                <p>Our mentorship program provides one-on-one mentorship for first-generation and low-income Latine identifying 
                    STEM/Engineering students at Northwestern. Mentees are matched with high-quality and committed mentors who are 
                    meant to support and encourage mentees in their journey at Northwestern and to provide the necessary guidance and 
                    support needed to succeed at Northwestern. This program runs quarterly and is encouraged that mentors/mentees continue 
                    to build upon their relationship after the quarter ends. </p>

                <p>High School Initiative Program (HSIP) is SHPEâ€™s Community Outreach recreation of Noche de Ciencas where we host 
                    different high schools from around the Evanston and Chicago area. This past Fall Quarter 2022, we revived the HSIP 
                    event after 6 years. Previous HSIP events had been hosted by NU SHPE in the spring. However, our team determined that 
                    hosting our events in the fall would be most useful to students applying to colleges in the following months especially 
                    if they are considering a career in STEM. Our event provided the following info:</p>
